# Integrating with Monorail

There are two ways Monorail integrates, the first is for Monorail to be able to route trades to your exchange, the second is for you to get quotes and route trades using the Monorail API.

## Supporting your exchange

At the moment, the Monorail team handles integrations with AMMs and orderbooks. Please contact us on Telegram at [@donorail](https://t.me/donorail)

## Using our API

The Monorail API is currently unstable and not available to the public. If you are interested in using the API (experimentally or otherwise), please contact us on Telegram at [@donorail](https://t.me/donorail)

As we approach Monad's mainnet launch, we will be releasing more information about the official API and how to use it.
